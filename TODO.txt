## Beautify

- refactor protocols naming									OK
- check homogeneity for _deep_flag_ family					OK


## TODO for 1.0.0

clean
- Clean BaseChain/Chain construction						OK
- no more requirejs pattern

DO
- hierarchy selection														OK
- SHared as _deep_compiler_ ?												OK
- finalise stores constraints (variabilise userID + filters)				OK		
- refactor _deep_ocm_ as _deep_flattener_ in flatten test function 			OK
- manage path in flatten for _deep_flattener_								OK
- store : serve schema														OK
- store : put/patch manage query nicely										OK


- reqrite RQL 																OK


- contextualise protocols 													OK
- OCM for what/how/where/done/fail 											OK
- OCM for inner store's methods												OK

- test context and modes 													OK		

- homogeneise second arguments (add third) for stores post/put/patch/del : 
	==> .post(obj, path, ?options) || .post(obj, ?options) 
- homogenise .createDefault of stores										OK


- introduce '' in deep.queries
- refactor swig + files accessors (json) for contextualised root (maybe multiple roots)				OK
- add options and head http action in restful middleware.											OK


- client micro caching + cache prefix with roles OR clearCache when roles change					
==> work globally on cache : deep.mediacache should manage FileWatch

- manage headers in autobahn : in config + middleware(s)											OK

- ligth DDP for deep : 
	: use local collection or object stores (as jstorage) that write/send datas : and invalidate if server do so.

- create first widgets
- add more dp-* 
- schema to form
- protocol to CMS 

- add sanitize in autobahn

## ROAD MAP for further version (higher than 1.0.0)

Workers : 

1.2.0 - Finalise Chain Identities Management										OK
1.3.0 - Optimise constraints and schema compilation. maybe externalise schema validation. manage error translation.
1.4.0 - Optimise DeepQuerier

1.1.0 - Finalise context and parano modes. maybe contextualised Emitter.



TODO : flag enhance:true|false in views										OK
Add all dp-* as deep_controlled (or _enhanced_) in controller

use class for selection for dp-*



rename resultType -> fullOutput												ok


rename deep.utils.preorder/inorder : depthFirst/breadthFirst				OK
add excludeLeafs in traversal												OK


add transform while traversal


check deep.log and error.



deep.loop ==> should return a ChainLoop Object : keep chain, restart it. two modes : regular cycle, wait end of chain cycle


in restful : explain how create dummy store.



extract deep-restful


sheet : sequential by default

var domSheet = {
	_deep_sheet_:true,
	"dom.transform::#selector":function(node){
		
	}
}

rethrow : add flag in context.

view enhance : 

	==> apply own sheets !!! what, how, where, SHEETS, done, fail


	==> seek class dp-enhance


		==> read "sheets" attribut
		==> apply dom sheets



rename _backgrounds : 			OK


FOREGROUNDS : try to implement it




refactor load sequence in view : one object wired arg-return	:					ok



remove deep.debug log in chain catch

__________________________________ STUDIES FROM BLUEBIRD

Add "state" method : isPending, isRejected, isResolved


Promise.longStackTraces();

rename deep.promise.immediate(...) by
deep.promise.resolve(...)


run should be renamed : "call" and have arguments list management 

bind / this : 

shoud managed it this way : 

.bind(obj)	// bind on object
.bind()		// use success
.bind(null)	// back to chain's bind


.catch(error, cb)
should be .fail(error, function(error){

})



maybe .join



done(value)
::> inject value, if it's a promise : forward state
==> replace .when in chain

CANCELLATION :  ?



DONE as end checker : rethrow any error
: could not be done in deep : because doesn't use fresh stack with process.tick or setTimeout
==> should be studied
____________________________________________________________


WARNING : 


check promise timeout






More : 
- closure-encapsulate all sensible store stuffs (real collection, schema, config)
	- need : late instance prototype compilation with closure wrapper function for applied layers and sheets that use sensible stuffs.
	- sensible stuffs should be categorized in : config (cache, uri, root folder, ...), schema, real collection (or driver stuffs)
	- sensible stuff should be definitly wrapped and hidded in closure at init of store. so schema and config or other needed datas need to be displaced from instance to closure.


- deep.utils.set(entry, "/path/[a,b,c]", value);  deep(...).set(path, value); + sheet : "dq.set::./path/[a,b,c]":...

- add flag in composition for managing error as callBack does, not as promise pipeline.

- manage publish/subscription between stores and/or objects (server side or browser side)


## ROAD MAP for other deepjs related libs.

- deep-http-client : node + jquery					OK (to be tested)
	- add jsonp capabilities (jsonp::...)
	- add EJSON

- deep-routes
	- add staters

- deep-data-bind
	- add reactive code linked to views (or not)

- deep-node : rewrite fs/json*  post/put/patch : use JSONObjectSheet

## Questions
- what to do with complex route params in restful ?   				OK

- how manage chain's identities.
specialy with stores vs values : query, range, stores particular API

- flatten and sheets : 
	- backgrounds and sheets
	- foregrounds ?					NO NEVER

## Todo details
- use ocm as prototypes in classe construction :  			OK (see deep.compose.ClassFactory)

- Events and context
	- Chain.on("event", callBack) that wrap holded one
	- deep.Emitter that conserve context ?

- use protocols space for different kinds of object (not only stores - e.g. socket)
==> use default handler in protocols : e.g. for stores : it's 'get'
==> in ocm : it could be in constructor options
==> need _deep_protocol_ object

- protocols and context
put protocols set in deep.context : ocmise present protocols = parano mode : consequence :  no possibility to change modes by after
('after' from context point of view)

==> when context is (simple)copied : we could contextualise protocols : for that we need to (simple)copy also protocols :
 allow to have local (contextualised) protocols space. Imply that late definition of protocols will only be local. 

==> maybe something like : 

deep.contextualize("protocols", deepCopy:Bool, parano:Bool) : will copy protocols (simple or deep) and apply OCM parano

deep.toContext()

deep.removeFromContext()

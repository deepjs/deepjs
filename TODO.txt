## Questions
- what to do with complex route params in restful ?

- how manage chain's identities.
specialy with stores vs values : query, range, stores particular API

- flatten an sheets : 
	- backgrounds and sheets
	- foregrounds ?					NO NEVER

## Todo
- Events and context
	- Chain.on("event", callBack) that wrap holded one
	- deep.Emitter that conserve context ?

- use protocols space for different kinds of object (not only stores - e.g. socket)
==> use default handler in protocols : e.g. for stores : it's 'get'
==> in ocm : it could be in constructor options
==> need _deep_protocol_ object

- Stores constraints
	- ownership : variabilise userID
	- add 'filters' in stores dynamic schema interpretation

- protocols and context
put protocols set in deep.context : ocmise present protocols = parano mode : consequence :  no possibility to change modes by after
('after' from context point of view)

==> when context is (simple)copied : we could contextualise protocols : for that we need to (simple)copy also protocols :
 allow to have local (contextualised) protocols space. Imply that late definition of protocols will only be local. 

==> maybe something like : 

deep.contextualize("protocols", deepCopy:Bool, parano:Bool) : will copy protocols (simple or deep) and apply OCM parano

deep.context()

deep.removeFromContext()

- use ocm as prototypes in classe construction :  			OK




deep.stores : 
	add jsonp capabilities (jsonp::...)

	serveSchema

	deep-cookies
 
	SYNCHED store
		save locally bunch of object : synch it with remote sto

deep-routes
	work on pattern : finalise it


data binders : 
	modularise binders

## Beautify

- refactor protocols naming									OK
- check homogeneity for _deep_flag_ family					OK


## TODO for 1.0.0

clean
- Clean BaseChain/Chain construction						OK
- no more requirejs pattern

DO
- hierarchy selection														OK
- SHared as _deep_compiler_ ?												OK
- finalise stores constraints (variabilise userID + filters)				OK		
- refactor _deep_ocm_ as _deep_flattener_ in flatten test function 			OK
- manage path in flatten for _deep_flattener_								OK

- test context and modes 																									
- Emitter and Context ?																	

Write
- More test cases
- More Docs

## ROAD MAP for further version (higher than 1.0.0)

1.1.0 - Finalise context and parano modes
1.2.0 - Finalise Chain Identities Management
1.3.0 - Optimise DeepQuerier and RQL
1.4.0 - Externalise Schema Validation + Error Translation Management


## ROAD MAP for other deepjs related libs.

- deep-http-client : node + jquery

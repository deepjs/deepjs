todo : 


manage OCM flatten in html and statics routes


when flatten object : flatten sub ocm

deep.store.AllowOnly("get","range")

what to do with route params in stores

add roles in in autobahn.context.middleware



Chain.on("event", callBack) that wrap holded one
deep.Emitter that conserve context ?


refactor protocols naming

check homogeneity for _deep_flag_ familly

one protocol space for different kinds of object (e.g. socket)



put protocols set in deep.context : ocmise present protocols = mode parano : not possible to change modes by after

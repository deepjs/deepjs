## Questions
- what to do with complex route params in restful ?

- how manage chain's identities.
specialy with stores vs values : query, range, stores particular API

- flatten an sheets : 
	- backgrounds and sheets
	- foregrounds ?

## Todo
- flatten
	- when flatten object : flatten sub ocm
		--> firstObjectWithProperty


- Events and context
	- Chain.on("event", callBack) that wrap holded one
	- deep.Emitter that conserve context ?

- use protocols space for different kinds of object (not only stores - e.g. socket)
==> use default handler in protocols : e.g. for stores : it's 'get'
==> in ocm : it could be in constructor options
==> need _deep_protocol_ object

- Stores constraints
	- ownership : variabilise userID
	- add 'filters' in stores dynamic schema interpretation

- protocols and context
put protocols set in deep.context : ocmise present protocols = parano mode : consequence :  no possibility to change modes by after
('after' from context point of view)

==> when context is (simple)copied : we could contextualise protocols : for that we need to (simple)copy also protocols :
 allow to have local (contextualised) protocols space. Imply that late definition of protocols will only be local. 

==> maybe something like : 

deep.contextualize("protocols", deepCopy:Bool, parano:Bool) : will copy protocols (simple or deep) and apply OCM parano

deep.context()

deep.removeFromContext()

- use ocm as prototypes in classe construction :  			OK

## Beautify

- refactor protocols naming
- check homogeneity for _deep_flag_ family
